# baSubwayObservatory
This is a project for monitoring subway activity based on Buenos Aires City [open data portal](http://data.buenosaires.gob.ar). The overall objective is to provide information about train frequency, train usage and problems in stations with train dispatch.

## Terminals

The terminals labeled as 1 are the ones in the periphery of the city, while the ones labeled as 2 are located in the city center. The exceptions are lines **C** and **H**, which have a transversal layout[1](http://data.buenosaires.gob.ar/dataset/subte-cronograma-de-servicio/resource/69c895c4-31de-4613-9b10-ec4e47d6b1c0). **P** line doesn't have a terminal 2.
